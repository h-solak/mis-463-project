Tunemix is a full-stack website that generates spotify playlists for businesses such as Caf√©s, Bars, or Clubs. This was a school project I built with a team. It runs a Python script on the backend side. I coded frontend and backend (using Node.js & MongoDB) of the website.

This repo also needs a database of spotify songs in order to run the python script.
